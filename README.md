# MSc-Dissertation-2022---St-Andrews

Authors: Antoine Moneyron and Jochen Kursawe

This repository includes the simulation code Antoine wrote for his Master Thesis at the University of St Andrews (2022), as well as for our recent manuscript [link to be included].

The files are organised as follows:

plotsForPaper-timeSeries.ipynb contains the code to generate figures 2 and 3A of the manuscript

plotsForPaper-mean-std-powerSpectra-COMPUTE.ipynb contains code to generate the data in Figure 3B and 4 of the manuscript

plotsForPaper-mean-std-powerSpectra-PLOT.ipynb contains code to generate figure 3B and 4 of the manuscript

generate_data_for_heatmap_plot.py contains code to generate the data in figure 5 of the manuscript.

plot_heatmap_from_data contains code to generate figure 5 of the manuscript.

The remaining files provide infrastructure that these scripts and notebooks work with.

# MSc-Dissertation-2022---St-Andrews

Authors: Antoine Moneyron and Jochen Kursawe

This repository includes the simulation code Antoine wrote for his Master Thesis at the University of St Andrews (2022), as well as for our recent manuscript [link to be included].

The files are organised as follows:

- `timeseries_figure_file_reorganised.py` contains code to generate all figures and supplementary figures of the revised manuscript, except for figure 5

- `generate_data_for_heatmap_plot.py` contains code to generate the data in figure 5 of the manuscript.

- `plot_heatmap_from_data.py` contains code to generate figure 5 of the manuscript.

The remaining files provide infrastructure that these scripts work with.

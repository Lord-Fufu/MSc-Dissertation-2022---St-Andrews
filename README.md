# Efficient approximations of transcriptional bursting effects on the dynamics of a gene regulatory network

This repository includes all simulation code for our paper in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface "Efficient approximations of transcriptional bursting effects on the dynamics of a gene regulatory network".

The files are organised as follows:

- `run_all.py` contains code to generate all figures and supplementary figures of the revised manuscript, except for figure 5

- `generate_data_for_heatmap_plot.py` contains code to generate the data in figure 5 of the manuscript.

- `plot_heatmap_from_data.py` contains code to generate figure 5 of the manuscript.

The remaining files provide infrastructure that these scripts work with.

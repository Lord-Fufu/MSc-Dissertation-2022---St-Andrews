# MSc-Dissertation-2022---St-Andrews

This repository includes the simulation code I wrote for my Master Thesis at the University of St Andrews (2022).
I worked on stochastic modelling of delayed chemical systems with fast environmental switching.
More specifically I simulated the production system of a protein: Hes1.

Python Files:
- reference method from the master equation using the Gillespie algorithm
- approximation methods using Langevin equations -> function can be used with or without the "switching drift"
- utility and post processing file

Notebook:
- file containing the plots

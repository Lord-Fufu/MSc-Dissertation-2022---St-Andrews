# MSc-Dissertation-2022---St-Andrews

Author: Antoine Moneyron

This repository includes the simulation code I wrote for my Master Thesis at the University of St Andrews (2022).
I worked on stochastic modelling of delayed chemical systems with fast environmental switching.
More specifically I simulated the production system of a the Hes1 protein.

Python Files:
- methods from the master equation using the Gillespie algorithm (reference)
- approximation methods using SDE Langevin equations (methods to be compared to reference)
- utility functions and post processing (e.g to compute power spectra and STDs)

Notebooks:
- perform computation, data saves and plots.

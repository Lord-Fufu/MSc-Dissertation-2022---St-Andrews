# MSc-Dissertation-2022---St-Andrews

This repository includes the simulation code I wrote for my Master Thesis at the University of St Andrews (2022).
I worked on stochastic modelling of delayed chemical systems with fast environmental switching.
More specifically I simulated the production system of a protein: Hes1.

Python Files:
- method from the master equation using the Gillespie algorithm (benchmark)
- approximation methods using SDE Langevin equations (method to be validated)
- utility and post processing

Notebook:
- perform computation, data saves and plots.
